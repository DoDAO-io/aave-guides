      "content": "\nDecentralized borrowing refers to the process of borrowing assets from a protocol run using smart contracts. In order to understand \nits workings and uses, we need to know a few of these important terms first.\n\n- **Liquidation:** - The selling of collateral to cover the debt is called liquidation.\n\n- **LTV (Loan to Value):** - Loan to value is the ratio used to decide how much loan can be borrowed against the \n  collateral produced. It is expressed in terms of percentages. (e.g., at LTV=75%, for every 1 ETH worth of collateral, \n  borrowers will be able to borrow 0.75 ETH worth of the corresponding currency). \n\n- **Liquidation Threshold:** - The liquidation threshold is the percentage at which a loan is deemed undercollateralized. \n  For example, a Liquidation threshold of 70% means that if the loan's value rises above 70% of the collateral, \n  the position is undercollateralized and could be liquidated.\n\n- **Liquidation Penalty:** - The liquidation penalty is a fee rendered on the price of assets of the collateral when \n  liquidators purchase it as part of the liquidation of a loan that has passed the liquidation threshold.\n\n- **Health Factor:** - It is a risk parameter that decides whether a borrow position is at risk of getting liquidated. \n  It is calculated by, `( H.F = ΣCollateral in ETH x Liquidation threshold / Total borrows )`\n",

      "content": "Over-colleteralized borrowing seems to be not relevant initially as the amount of collateral needed to borrow the \ntokens can be quite high. But there are many use cases for it.\n* **Yield Farming** - The process involves leveraging DeFi protocols to lend cryptocurrencies for high returns that can \n  go up to 100% APY (Annual Percentage Yield). Yield farming originates from banks’ process in lending your deposits; the difference \n  is that DeFi yield farming compounds the interest earned.\n\n* **Arbitrage** - Arbitrage takes advantage of the fact that an asset may be worth more in one market than another. While \n  this usually happens because of market inefficiencies, it can also be used to exploit differences in rates between \n  different platforms.\n\n* **Margin Trading (Leverage)** - Taking out a loan with extra collateral can help you gain leverage, and you can repeat \n  the process until you reach the limit.\n\n* **Liquidation** - Liquidations can be quite profitable, especially for tech-savvy traders. Usually, a liquidator has to \n  compete against other people for the same job, so he uses bots. They work by \"sniping\" the loans that are under the \n  collateralization ratio. This way, they can liquidate the collateral and reimburse the lender. In turn, the liquidator \n  receives a reward fee for his services.\n\n* **Risk-reduction/Hedging** - No matter how well you think you know the markets, there will always be bumps in the road. As \n  a trader, you need to find ways to protect your investment from risk, and this is where crypto hedging strategies come in. \n  Hedging encompasses opening positions in opposing market directions to reduce the risks and impacts of market swings. By doing this, \n  you can help to offset any potential losses that might occur.\n",

This might happen when the collateral decreases in value or the borrowed debt increases in value \nagainst each other. This collateral vs loan value ratio is shown in the health factor (H.F.).\n\nThe Health Factor (HF) of a loan needs to stay above one at all times. If the HF falls below one, it means that \nthe loan is undercollateralized and the collateral will be liquidated. To bring the HF back up to more than one, \nthe collateral is sold off to a liquidity provider with an incentive bonus. The users who pay off the loans and \nbuy collateral are called liquidators.\n\n## Preventation of Liquidation\n\nLiquidation is an event triggered by the Health Factor value of loan dipping below 1. \n\nThis can be prevented by two ways.\n1. Deposit more collateral into the loan\n2. Repay part of the loan such that the H.F. goes comfortably above 1. \n\nOne should be mindful of the token price fluctuations due to market conditions and how it might affect one’s H.F.\n\n## Significance of Liquidation\nThe system of liquidation is good for those who do the liquidations because they get a significant amount of money \nas a reward. This acts as an incentive to make sure that lenders are provided with safety against loan defaults and \nbad loans. Liquidations are especially useful during bearish markets when viewed from the lender's point of view.\n",
