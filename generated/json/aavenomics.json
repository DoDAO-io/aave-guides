Aavenomics represents the autonomy granted to the protocol and the AAVE token \nas a core securing element of the Aave Protocol. Aavenomics functions based on a unique risk incentivization \nframework. The Aave holders bear the risk of the protocol and in return they are incentivized.\n\nThe holders of Aave tokens who stake the coin can participate in the security module and earn a yield of  around 7% \nas the compensation for contributing to the security of the protocol. In exchange, their staked $AAVE tokens could \nbe slashed up to 30% in the event of a liquidity crisis for the protocol. \n\nAave is secured by a Safety Module which serves as a staking mechanism for AAVE tokens to act as insurance against \nShortfall Events. Stakers can earn Safety  Incentives along with a certain percentage of the protocol fees.\n\nStaked AAVE will be freely tradable after a cooldown period. All rewards accrue in real time and are distributed \nas AAVE is withdrawn or transferred from the Safety Module.\n",

The token holders are incentivized to lock tokens into a Smart Contract-based component called the Safety \nModule (SM).\n\nThe tokens deposited here act as a cushion incase of a short fall event, wherein a deficit arises and funds are \nrequired. The occurrence of a shortfall event involves selling off the locked AAVE by the process of auctioning in \norder to set off the deficit.\n\nThe presence of a built-in backstop mechanism prevents excess flow of AAVE ensuring that the value of Aave itself \nis not reduced. The AAVE holders secure the protocol by locking AAVE tokens in return for receiving rewards, in the form \nof Safety Incentives (SI).\n\nTo contribute to the safety of the protocol and receive incentives, AAVE holders deposit their tokens into the Safety Module \nand receive a tokenized position.\n\nThe share from the Safety Module can be redeemed by the holder of the tokenized position at any time, triggering a cooldown period of one week.\n\nThe main role of the Safety Module is to protect the protocol against unexpected loss of funds arising from various \nshortfall events which include\n\n* **Smart contract risk** : The risks of a bug in the system, design flaw or potential attack surfaces on the smart \ncontract layer.\n\n* **Liquidation risk** : The risk of failure of an asset that is being used as collateral on Aave.\n\n* **Oracle failure risk** : Risk of the Oracle system not properly updating the prices in case of extreme market \ndownturn and network congestion; risk of the Oracle system not properly submitting prices, causing improper \nliquidations.\n",

For Aave, the common goal is to ensure the safety of the Aave Protocol, cost-efficient usage by the market \nparticipants, and proper ecosystem incentives to drive innovation and long-term growth of the ecosystem.\n\nAAVE holders get to participate in two type of incentives\n\n### 1. Safety Incentives (SI)      \nSafety Incentives ensure the safety of the protocol by incentivizing AAVE holders to participate in the Safety \nModule. This is achieved with a set of incentives pushing behavior to naturally create a positive feedback loop \nwithin the Aave Protocol. In that sense, the essence of those systemic incentives is to materially fade away while \nhaving a lasting impact on participants' behavior. This behavior materializes with the birth of policy motivated \nagents that have incorporated the sustainability of the system they now belong to.\n\nAAVE holders participating in the Safety Module earn both Safety Incentives in the form of AAVE and fees from the protocol.\n\nSI rewards are subject to a cooldown period of seven days where tokens are unclaimable.\nHowever, fees generated by the protocol are continuously allocated to the users participating in the SM and can be \nwithdrawn and are redistributed to the SI participants.\nThe participants are incentivized with the rewards for contributing to the safety of the protocol in its early stages.\nThe SI emission is controlled by the governance and adjusted to the protocol's needs.\n\n### 2. Ecosystem Incentives (EI)      \nRepresents the part of the periodic issuance of AAVE (EI) used to incentivize liquidity providers, software \ndevelopers and integrators to build value within the Aave ecosystem.\n",
