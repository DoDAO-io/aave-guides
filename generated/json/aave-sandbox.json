Set up a code editor like VScode and install node js and git.\n2. Clone repository using git clone [https://github.com/aave/aave-sandbox.git](https://github.com/aave/aave-sandbox.git)\n3. Install npm i (type npm i in the terminal for installation).\n4. Create a .env file.(touch.env)\n5. Create an alchemy key from the alchemy website\n\n### What is a Hardhat node?\n\nHardhat is a framework for testing, running, and deploying smart contracts and scripts in the blockchain. It features clear error messages, \nforking the mainnet and other networks, mining nodes, logging, etc.\n\nHardhat Network has the ability to copy the state of the mainnet blockchain into your local environment, including all balances and deployed contracts. \nThis is known as the \"forking mainnet.\"\n",
