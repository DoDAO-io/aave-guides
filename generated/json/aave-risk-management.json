      "content": "The Aave protocol is a popular liquidity protocol on Ethereum. It allows users to supply and borrow crypto assets \non Ethereum. Active borrowers who are willing to pay interest have access to pools of crypto assets supplied by \nusers who seek yield on their savings.\n\nDeFi is all about liquidity; without it, the whole ecosystem would grind to a halt. And because of the way that different \ncomponents in DeFi are interconnected, any risks in one area can quickly flow through the entire system. With the \nmarket growing so quickly, it's more important than ever to remember that there are many risks associated with DeFi.\n\nAave's risk framework provides a comprehensive guide for the different risks associated \nwith the protocol as well as the different ways to mitigate them. By taking into account market, counterparty, and \nsmart contract risks, Aave Protocol aims to set a higher standard for risk management within the DeFi space.\n\nThe team at Aave constantly strives to make the protocol safer.\n",

      "content": "Aave enables users to supply and borrow digital assets through liquidity pools. Suppliers receive protocol-issued \naTokens, holding the user’s supplied assets and accrued yield.\n\nThe collateral secures each borrow and acts as a risk mitigation tool against default.\n\nFollowing are the risks associated with the addition of tokens -\n\n### Increase in gas price\nAdding of a new token can lead to increase in gas prices for most of the protocol operations. So it's important to \nknow the impact on the protocol. \n\n### The protocol risk of insolvency      \n  Adding a new token involves the risk of insolvency. While adding new tokens the Aave Community considers the \n  following important points -      \n    1. Only the assets with best risk profiles should be supported as collateral\n    2. Riskier assets should only be enabled as collateral in isolation mode\n    3. New assets with higher risk and lower liquidity should be only considered listed in Isolation mode (for both borrow and collateral use)\n\n### Centralisation risk      \nA centralized asset accepted as collateral exposes the protocol to centralization risk. The single point of failure \nrisks of the underlying tokens enter into the Aave Protocol due to the centralized asset being accepted as collateral.\n\n### Risk of collateral assets\nTokens that are enabled only for supplying and borrowing and are not usable as collateral, present lower risk for \nthe protocol. Collaterals are the assets of the protocol. For solvency, these assets must remain greater than the \nliabilities borrowed from the protocol. Tokens that can only be used for borrowing should always be excessively backed \nby collateral assets (e.g., a user can supply DAI as collateral and borrow DAI in variable mode backed by DAI as collateral).\n\n### Risk of manipulable oracles      \nAssets that have risk of manipulable oracles are listed as single borrow assets. If a user borrows the mentioned asset, \nthey cannot borrow any other asset (Siloed assets).\n\n### Token Concentration(Low diversity)\nIf there are just a couple of tokens in the protocol, then volatilie conditions of those tokens can affect the full protocol. But by \nhaving many markets/pools, the risk is diversified.\n",

      "content": "\n## Smart contract risk\nThe focus of smart contract risk is on assessing the security of the code that underlies any asset. Only code that \nhas been thoroughly audited by well-respected auditors is appropriate for the Aave protocol. Users are advised to \nbe vigilant, as even beyond audits, smart contract risk does exist and it can never be eliminated completely.\n\nOne interesting mechanism that Aave plans to use to help reduce smart contract risk is bug bounties.\n\nAlso, to prevent hacks, Aave protocol advices to onboard the contracts with strict risk mitigation such as supply caps or isolation mode.\n\n## Counterparty Risk\nWhen it comes to decentralized governance models, there are varying degrees to which control over funds (or even \nattack vectors) may be given to the governing architecture. \n\nCounterparty risk is determined by the level of centralization within the system, which can be measured by \nthings like the number of parties controlling a token's protocol, as well as the number and distribution of holders, \nand the level of trust in the entity, project, or community running the show.      \n\n## Market Risk      \nAave assesses market risk by taking into account the size of the asset pool, as well as supply and demand. The \nmarket needs to have enough volume to handle any liquidations, which can lower the price of the asset. Aave uses \naverage daily volume to assess liquidity risk.\n\nThe volatility risk is based on the normalized fluctuations in the token price and is calculated as the standard \ndeviation of the logarithmic returns.\n\nTokens can be subject to sudden volatility spikes, and it is not uncommon to witness a 50% price change within a \nweek or a month. When a price increase occurs, a parameter readjustment may be implemented to limit the risks of \nnew operations.\n\nFinally, Aave also considers the market capitalisation representing the size of the market and potential exposure.\n\nMarket risks are used to calibrate the model’s risk parameters. Volatility helps to define the required level of \ncollateralisation. The liquidity risks are contained by liquidation incentives.\n",

      "content": "The liquidity of the protocol is very important as it allows for the basic protocol operations to take place, such \nas borrowing assets that are backed by collateral. It also allows users to claim supplied assets along with the \ninterest that has accrued. Measuring the liquidity is done by taking into account the utilisation ratio, which is \nthe amount of the reserve that is currently borrowed in relation to the Aave supply of each asset.\n\nThere are tools in place to help mitigate liquidity risk, such as the borrow interest rate model and alternative \nsources of aToken liquidity.\n\nAave mitigates the liquidity risk by the following two ways\n\n### 1. Borrow Interest Rate\nAave's interest rate algorithm is designed to carefully manage liquidity risk and optimize utilization. The borrow \ninterest rates are derived from the Utilisation Rate, which is an indicator of the availability of capital within \nthe pool. The interest rate model manages liquidity risk in the protocol by incentivizing users to support liquidity: When capital is available, \nlow interest rates encourage borrowing. When capital is scarce, high interest rates encourage repayments of debt and additional supplying.\n\n### 2. aToken Liquidity\nIn order to mitigate aTokens' liquidity risk, Aave has set up liquidity pools on Uniswap and Balancer, as well as \nthe Aave Curve pool. This provides users with alternative sources of liquidity, enabling them to redeem aTokens \neven when there is no liquidity available in the protocol.\n",
