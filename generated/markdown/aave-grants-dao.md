## Overview

# **Overview**

![Aave](https://2799188404-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-legacy-files/o/assets%2F-MDtoSpz9ekPafgSK8Bl%2F-MDvO-yzDivYrBvizXRW%2F-MDvO2lOYLIPFLa6WEUO%2Faave%20overview.png?alt=media&token=5a4c8be8-d473-4041-b58c-a37234bd15fd "Aave")

Aave is a decentralized non-custodial liquidity protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain where users can provide liquidity to earn interest or borrow by providing collateral of tokens owned. It is completely open-source so people can build third-party solutions on the Aave Protocol via API or by directly interacting with the smart contracts on the Ethereum Network.

Currently, Aave has integrated with a number of L1 (Polygon, Avalanche) and L2 (Arbitrum) networks. It is also a decentralized organization and is governed by the community via the AAVE token which is used to vote for the growth of the DAO based on Aave Improvement Proposals (AIP). 

Beyond voting, AAVE can also be staked in within the Protocol Safety Module to provide Insurance to depositors on the Protocol.
