    name: Introduction

      Aave is an open source non-custodial liquidity protocol that allows users to receive interest on their 
      cryptocurrency investments and borrow digital assets through over-collateralized loans.
  
      Aavenomics refers to the tokenkomics of the Aave protocol and it presents a governance framework to grant decision 
      making powers to AAVE token holders. Aavenomics represents the autonomy granted to the protocol and the AAVE token 
      as a core securing element of the Aave Protocol. Aavenomics functions based on a unique risk incentivization 
      framework. The Aave holders bear the risk of the protocol and in return they are incentivized.
      
      The holders of Aave tokens who stake the coin can participate in the security module and earn a yield of  around 7% 
      as the compensation for contributing to the security of the protocol. In exchange, their staked $AAVE tokens could 
      be slashed up to 30% in the event of a liquidity crisis for the protocol. 
      
      Aave is secured by a Safety Module which serves as a staking mechanism for AAVE tokens to act as insurance against 
      Shortfall Events. Stakers can earn Safety  Incentives along with a certain percentage of the protocol fees.
      
      Staked AAVE will be freely tradable after a cooldown period. All rewards accrue in real time and are distributed 
      as AAVE is withdrawn or transferred from the Safety Module.

    name: Aave Token Governance
    content: |
      AAVE, the governance token of the Aave protocol, is an ERC-20 token that runs on the Ethereum blockchain which needs 
      to be earned instead of being minted.
      
      The ways to earn Aave include buying it on exchanges and then staking it within the protocol’s “safety module.”
      Aave Protocol offers governance powers and financial rewards.
      
      AAVE ,the governance token of the protocol, grants the token holders the right to make proposals, cast their vote on 
      protocol parameters and decide on new parameters in the ecosystem. The token shares the power between stakeholders 
      within the Aave ecosystem in order to secure the Aave Protocol.
      
      The components of Aave Genesis governance architecture's smart contracts are-
      
      **Aave proto governance**

      Aave proto governance is a core component of governance which allows voting by the LEND token holders and permits 
      the execution of approved proposals. Only LEND tokens are allowed to vote with one token being equivalent to one vote.
      
      This contract includes the ownerships needed to execute the proposals containing all the bootstrapping actions of 
      the Aave ecosystem. Asset Voting Weight Provider defines weights a voter can vote on proposals.
      
      **Governance Process**

      The Governance Process is undertaken via governance forums at governance.aave.com and ratified through on-chain Aave Improvement Proposals (AIPs) using AAVE.
      The AAVE token empowers holders to collectively act as governors of the protocol by enabling them with the capability to vote and propose.
      For the $AAVE token, Aave has committed to utilize treasury reserves to buy and burn $AAVE tokens, which would imply a decrease in supply and a possibility of increase in price.

    name: Safety module
    content: |
      Aave’s safety module serves the dual purpose of providing security to the platform and incentivizing the token 
      holders. The token holders are incentivized to lock tokens into a Smart Contract-based component called the Safety 
      Module (SM).
      
      The tokens deposited here act as a cushion incase of a short fall event, wherein a deficit arises and funds are 
      required. The occurrence of a shortfall event involves selling off the locked AAVE by the process of auctioning in 
      order to set off the deficit.
      
      The presence of a built-in backstop mechanism prevents excess flow of AAVE ensuring that the value of Aave itself 
      is not reduced. The AAVE holders secure the protocol by locking Aave in return for receiving rewards, in the form 
      of Safety Incentives (SI).
      
      To contribute to the safety of the protocol and receive incentives, AAVE holders deposit their tokens into the SM 
      and receive a tokenized position.

      The share from SM can be redeemed anytime by the holder of the tokenized position can be redeemed any time which shall 
      trigger a cooldown period of one week. The holder of the tokenized position can redeem their share from the Safety module 
      at any time, triggering a cooldown period of one week.
      
      The main role of the Safety Module is to protect the protocol against unexpected loss of funds arising from various 
      shortfall events which include-

      * **Smart contract risk** : The risks of a bug in the system, design flaw or potential attack surfaces on the smart 
      contract layer.

      * **Liquidation risk** : The risk of failure of an asset that is being used as collateral on Aave.

      * **Oracle failure risk** : Risk of the Oracle system not properly updating the prices in case of extreme market 
      downturn and network congestion; risk of the Oracle system not properly submitting prices, causing improper 
      liquidations.

    name: Staking and earning rewards
    content: | 
      Financial incentives are used to shape behaviors within the Aave ecosystem with the objective of achieving a common 
      objective. For Aave, the common goal is to ensure the safety of the Aave Protocol, cost-efficient usage by the market 
      participants, and proper ecosystem incentives to drive innovation and long-term growth of the ecosystem.
      
      Aave is secured by a Safety Module (SM), a staking mechanism for AAVE tokens to act as insurance against 
      Shortfall Events. Stakers earn AAVE as Safety Incentives (SI) along with a percentage of protocol fees.
      
      ### Safety Incentives (SI)      
      Safety Incentives ensure the safety of the protocol by incentivizing AAVE holders to participate in the Safety 
      Module. This is achieved with a set of incentives pushing behavior to naturally create a positive feedback loop 
      within the Aave Protocol. In that sense, the essence of those systemic incentives is to materially fade away while 
      having a lasting impact on participants' behavior. This behavior materializes with the birth of policy motivated 
      agents that have incorporated the sustainability of the system they now belong to.
      
      AAVE holders participating in the Safety Module earn both Safety Incentives in the form of AAVE and fees from the protocol.
      
      SI rewards are subject to a cooldown period of seven days where tokens are unclaimable.
      However, fees generated by the protocol are continuously allocated to the users participating in the SM and can be 
      withdrawn and are redistributed to the SI participants.
      The participants are incentivized with the rewards for contributing to the safety of the protocol in its early stages.
      The SI emission is controlled by the governance and adjusted to the protocol's needs.
      
      ### Ecosystem Incentives (EI)      
      Represents the part of the periodic issuance of AAVE (AI) used to incentivise liquidity providers, software 
      developers and integrators to build value within the Aave ecosystem.
