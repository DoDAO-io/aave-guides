      ### Lending

      * The act of allowing someone else or another entity to use the lender's
      assets.

      * The lender gets compensated for his contribution in the form of
      interest.

      * Lending helps prevent the value of assets (especially money) from
      degrading over time.

      * Returns on lending to banks are fixed and stable, But minuscule.


      ### Borrowing

      * Borrowing is the act of receiving something from someone under the
      agreement that the asset or an agreed-upon equivalent of the asset
      borrowed will be returned after a certain period. 

      * The agreed-upon equivalent against which a loan is taken is called
      collateral.

      * The purpose of borrowing is to use an asset you do not currently have by
      producing something you already own as security of repayment of the
      borrowed asset.

      * Borrowing from banks requires a good credit score to get a decent offer
      on loan.


      ### Advantages of Lending and borrowing

      * Lending and borrowing facilitate the flow of resources from the people
      with surplus resources who do not have a use for them and people without a
      particular resource in necessary amounts. This trading, of time value of
      assets benefits both the parties.

      * Lending prevents the devaluation of money held by a person by generating
      value via interests.

      * Lending ensures the circulation of resources held in surplus which
      otherwise would be locked up with one person/ entity and unusable.

      * Lending and borrowing play a crucial role in the ecosystem of small
      businesses. Providing them with resources they otherwise would not have to
      sustain their business initially.

      ## Some General Terms in finance

      **Liquidation** - The act of turning assets into cash is called
      liquidation. The assets held by an entity in the form of cash are called
      liquid assets. The ability of an asset to be converted into cash is
      generally referred to as Liquidability.


      **Credit/FICO score** - A credit score from 300 to 850 depicts a
      consumerâ€™s credibility. It is based on credit history, timely loan
      repayments, etc. The higher the credit score, The more likely you are to
      get a better loan offer.


      **Collateral** - Asset against which something is borrowed.


      **Interest rate** - The part of the loan that is charged as interest to
      the borrower. The rate of premium paid over the actual amount borrowed.


      **Return of investment** - The portion of the investment provided as an
      incentive for providing liquidity or letting your assets be borrowed is
      called the rate of returns.


      **Over-collateralization** - When the value of the collateral provided
      supersedes the value of assets borrowed, It is called
      over-collateralization.


      **Financial solvency** - The Ability of an entity to meet its long-term
      debts and other financial obligations.


      **Borrowing capacity** - The maximum amount an entity can borrow without
      compromising its financial solvency.


      **APY** - APY stands for Annual Percentage Yield. It is the total amount
      of money, i.e., the return of investment earned by a bank account in a
      year.


      **APR** - APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It refers to the interest
      generated by the sum lent or borrowed in a year.


      **Inflation** - It is the rate of rise in prices of goods and services.


      **Mortgage** - It is collateral produced in the loans taken for housing,
      Where the collateral is the real estate 

      itself. It is basically an agreement between the lender and borrower that
      allows the lender to take ownership of 

      the property in case of default in repayment by the borrower.


      **Loan-to-value (LTV) ratio** - Often used in mortgage assessment. It is
      an assessment of lending risk that lenders 

      examine before approving a mortgage. Often used in mortgage lending in
      order to determine the amount to be put in a 

      down payment and whether a lender will extend credit to a borrower. It is
      to be noted that lower LTVs are more 

      favorable to the lenders. LTV = (Mortgage amount / Appraised property
      value)

      ### Principle

      Lenders deposit their money in banks. The bank then uses this money and
      provides loans to borrowers for some rate of interest. The lenders are
      compensated with interest for their contribution.

      The difference in APR provided to lenders and borrowers is the bank's
      revenue.


      ### Working      

      * They run on a trust-based/credibility-based system calcuated by FICO
      score.

      * Involves multiple agreements and paperwork. 

      * On getting sanctioned, The loan must be repaid along with interest
      within the period of the loan.

      * Usually, the repayment period varies from one to seven years.


      ### Fees

      * **Application fee** : For the process of applying for a loan.

      * **Processing fee** : For the processing/sanctioning of a loan.

      * **Origination fee** : The cost of securing a loan.

      * **Annual fee** : A yearly fee that must be paid to the lender.

      * **Late fee** : The fee paid on late pay

      * **Prepayment fee** : The cost of paying a loan off early.


      ### Advantages  


      * **Heavily regulated** - Though there is a possibility of scams, there
      are regulatory bodies whose job is to protect the consumer and
      stakeholders.      

      * **Accountability** - The possibility of your assets getting locked
      without return is next to impossible.

      * **Accessibility** - Banks have a well-developed supply chain.



      ### Disadvantages        

      * **Inefficient** - Banks spend large sums of money to setup fancy
      buildings and offices, and the workforce in banks 

      consisting primarily of people is prone to inefficiency and burnout.  Not
      to forget the process of loans is an 

      extensively time-consuming process with a lot of paperwork.


      * **Transparency and Returns** - The banks do not disclose their profits
      and margins to the general public. Banks 

      often offer paltry returns to the lender in comparison to other investment
      opportunities. Note that the lesser the 

      returns offered to the lender, more the profit margin for the banks. One
      can see how this can be problematic. 
            
      * **Lack of innovation** - The banking sector has been acting on
      more-or-less the same principles and workings 

      without too many changes in the last 10 or so years.

      The financial organizations and protocols in the blockchain that work on a
      decentralized version of traditional finance are called DeFi
      organizations. 


      ### Principle

      * Same as the traditional lending and borrowing system: the borrower puts
      up collateral to be able to borrow, and the lender gets compensated for
      sharing his resources

      * An intermediary is absent.

      * No concept of credit or trust.


      ### Working      

      * The protocol maintains a "liquidity pool(s)" where all lenders' assets
      (liquidity) get pooled.

      * There can be a single pool for the entire platform or they might be
      split based on asset types, or some other strategy

      * The borrowers ask for a loan by providing a collateral. Often the loans
      in DeFi are over collateralized.

      * The platform ensure that the borrowed positions remain healthy at all
      times. If the value of the collateral added by the borrower, drops below a
      certain threshold, the loans are liquidated. 

      * The liquidated funds are sold to independent liquidators at a discounted
      price. This is done to ensure immediate settlement.

      * There can be a  transaction feel added by the platforms and a
      liquidation fee incase the loans get liquidated.

      * After deducting of any platform fees or interest, the interest that is
      gained from the borrowers, goes to the lenders. Because of the
      competition, and transparency, plat fees are often quite low.

      * The platform might also choose to incentivize either, lender, or
      borrower, or both, in order to promote a particular side or to promote
      overall growth of the platform.


      ### Advantages      

      * **Speed** - DeFi lending platforms are made possible by blockchain
      technology and the rules for lending and borrowing 

      are encoded into the Smart Contract. This helps to expedite the process as
      there is no human interaction required and 

      the actions are performed instantaneously. The majority of services
      provided by DeFi platforms are available 24x7.       


      * **Open** - No lengthy processes, assessments, and paperwork go into
      applying for a loan. All you need is a crypto wallet.


      * **Immutability** - Blockchain's decentralized architecture ensures that
      the data it contains cannot be tampered with making 

      it far more trustable. 



      ### Disadvantages      

      * **Taxes** -The user has to maintain their record for tax purposes, and
      it varies from region to region, causing much confusion. 


      * **Volatility** -The Crypto market is highly volatile.


      * **Tech failures and hacks** - Tech failures have caused a substantial
      quantity of assets to be locked up in a smart contract.

      hierarchy.                                                               |
      DeFi's structure is decentralized, and there is no ultimate governing
      body.              |

      | In traditional finance the bank or some other financial institution acts
      as an intermediary between the lender and the buyer. It makes profits off
      of the difference in rates of interest it specifies. | DeFi has no
      intermediary, and the transaction follows a peer-to-peer structure or
      peer-protocol-peer structure with no central
      authority                            |

      | Banks have an extensive process of checking the borrower's eligibility.
      They have lengthy Application and sanctioning. They also levy fees on
      these processes.                                           | In DeFi,
      however, it is seamless, and often the borrower only needs to have a
      crypto wallet to get a loan. |

      | In Traditional finance, we do not over-collateralize. We use an asset as
      collateral to get assets against
      it.                                                                                           
      | However, In DeFi, the idea of over-collateralization is adopted to
      protect againt vollatility of
      assets                                           |

      | The rate of returns in traditional finance is
      paltry.                                                                                                                                                   
      | On average DeFi lending offers much more return on investment than
      traditional lending.                    |
