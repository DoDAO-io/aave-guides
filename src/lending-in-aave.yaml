      ### Lending in Web3
      Crypto Projects use the money lent in various ways like Staking on different protocols for  Yield Farming, interest, etc. There is no limit for lending assets. 
      lending money is even more opaque than traditional finance, and the user is not informed about how the money is being used. So the user should be aware of 
      how the funds will be used and the risks associated with lending the money. AAVE is a lending and borrowing protocol provide full transparency on how the 
      pool of the funds lent by users is deployed.Lending in Aave doesn't require any personal data.Lending through Aave gives some advantages over traditional lending, 
      such as no taxes and the possibility of higher returns. The elimination of the middlemen makes the protocol profitable for lenders as the borrowers 
      interest mostly goes to lenders.
      
      
      ### Important Terms       
      1. **APY-** The annual percentage yield (APY) is the real rate of return earned on an investment, taking into account the effect of compounding interest. 
      2. **aTokens-** aTokens are the interest-bearing tokens which is minted and burnt in 1:1 ratio upon deposit and redeem.
      3. **ERC-20-** The ERC-20 introduces a standard for Fungible Tokens. In other words, they have a property that makes each Token precisely the same 
      (in type and value) as another Token.
      4. **Deposit interest-** A deposit interest rate is the rate at which you earn money from a bank or financial institution on your deposits in an 
      interest-bearing account.
      5. **Stablecoins-** A stablecoin is a digital currency pegged to a stable reserve asset like the U.S. dollar or gold. Stablecoins are designed to 
      reduce volatility relative to unpegged cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.
      6. **Flashloan -** Loans can be borrowed without collateral through smart contracts. This process is instant and can help borrowers get the money 
      they need quickly.
      7. **ROI -** Return on investment is a performance measure used to evaluate the efficiency or profitability of an investment or compare the 
      efficiency of several different investments.
      8. **LTV-** loan to value, it represents the borrowing power of the collateral.
      9. **Health Factor -** The health factor determines whether a user is eligible to borrow a loan or not.

    content: |
      ### How Lending  works in Aave

      Aave's lending is entirely decentralized, so there's no need to share personal information. Aave uses a tokenization strategy to provide liquidity. 
      Users can work with the platform without worrying about sharing their data. Upon deposit, the depositor receives a corresponding amount of derivative tokens 
      called aTokens .aTokens are minted in a 1:1 ratio. The balance of aTokens of every depositor grows over time, driven by the perpetual accrual of interest of 
      deposits. aTokens are fully ERC20 compliant. The lender's money is stored within each specific aToken.This gives the protocol better segregation between assets,
      which favors the implementation of yield farming aware aTokens.

      ** Deposit**

      Whenever a user deposits or lends assets, the liquidity of the protocol is increased. The protocol updates the interest rates according to the liquidity. 
      Mint equivalent amount of aTokens in 1:1 ratio. Transferring assets to the reserve is a crucial step in asset management. The reserve is where all assets 
      are stored, so this step must be carried out correctly. Whenever user deposits an amount m in the protocol, his scaled balance updates as follows
        
       ScBt(x) = ScBt-1(x) + m/NIt
       Where,
      * ScB is the scaled balance 
      * m is the deposited amount
      * NIt is the ongoing interest cumulated by the reserve
     
      **Supply APY**
     
      The borrow interest rates paid are distributed as yield for aToken holders supplied to the protocol, excluding a share of yields sent to the ecosystem 
      reserve defined by the reserve factor. This interest rate is generated on the asset that is borrowed out and then shared among all the liquidity providers. 
      The supply APY, S
       S = Ut(SBt*St+VBt*Vt)(1−Rt)
       
      * Ut -Utilization ratio It is the ratio of total borrowed assets and total liquidity in the protocol.
      * SBt- share of stable borrows, It is the total assets borrowed at a stable rate in percentage.
      * St-the average stable rate, is the average stable rate of that particular asset.
      * VBt-share of variable borrows, It is the total amount borrowed  in variable rate in percentage.
      * Vt, variable rate, 
      * Rt, reserve factor

      The average supply rate in a period includes flash loan fees. The interest generated is represented as aTokens.If the user decides to redeem the assets, 
      they can withdraw them instantly to their wallet. During the process, the aTokens will be burnt, and the assets will be supplied to the user’s wallet.
      
      **Redeem**
      
      In the process of withrawing the aTokens are burnt to redeem the underlying assets. Reserve must have enough liquidity and user's health factor must be above 1 
      to withraw assets.

      ### How the lent assets are utilized 

      The lenders will deposit their assets into the Aave protocol so that they receive a corresponding number of aTokens, representing the asset on a 1:1 basis. 
      The aToken gradually gains value as interest is accrued on the underlying asset. This article will explain how the protocol generates profits for lenders in 
      the form of interest payments. Since the protocol is decentralized, these profits are paid directly to the lenders.

      **Providing overcollateralized loans**

      The assets in Aave can be borrowed instantly with the concept of over-collateralization. The borrowers need to lock collateral to get loans. The loan is 
      offered only when the health factor is greater than one. So when the health factor tends to one, the protocol automatically liquidates the collateral locked 
      by the borrower. The health factor above one implies that the loans are overcollateralized. so in this way, the protocol maintains its safety. 

      **Flashloans**

      Flash loans are loans that can be borrowed without collateral through smart contracts. This process is instant and can help borrowers get the money they 
      need quickly. The protocol provides flash loans at a fee of 0.09% of the borrowed amount. Usually, they are borrowed for arbitrage trading, liquidation of 
      assets, collateral swap, margin trading, etc. Flash loans are usually borrowed at a high value, so the potential profits are higher. However, to execute the 
      flash loan, all transactions must be included in a single block, or else the transaction is reverted. If the borrowed amount is high enough, this can give a 
      massive profit to the protocol. Flashloans are not accessible to everyone because they can be borrowed only through smart contracts.

      **Liquidation call**

      When the health factor of a position is below 1, liquidators repay part or all of the outstanding borrowed amount on behalf of the borrower while receiving a 
      discounted amount of collateral in return, also known as a liquidation bonus. Liquidators can decide if they want to receive an equivalent amount of collateral 
      aTokens, or the underlying asset directly. When the liquidation is completed successfully, the health factor of the position is increased, bringing the health 
      factor above 1.
