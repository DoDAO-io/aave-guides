      The Aave protocol is a popular liquidity protocol on Ethereum. It allows users to supply and borrow crypto assets 
      on Ethereum. Active borrowers who are willing to pay interest have access to pools of crypto assets supplied by 
      users who seek yield on their savings.
      
      DeFi is all about liquidity; without it, the whole ecosystem would grind to a halt. And because of the way that different 
      components in DeFi are interconnected, any risks in one area can quickly flow through the entire system. With the 
      market growing so quickly, it's more important than ever to remember that there are many risks associated with DeFi.
      
      Aave's risk framework provides a comprehensive guide for the different risks associated 
      with the protocol as well as the different ways to mitigate them. By taking into account market, counterparty, and 
      smart contract risks, Aave Protocol aims to set a higher standard for risk management within the DeFi space.
      
      The team at Aave constantly strives to make the protocol safer.

    name: Risk by Addition of a new token
    content: |
      Aave enables users to supply and borrow digital assets through liquidity pools. Suppliers receive protocol-issued 
      aTokens, holding the user’s supplied assets and accrued yield.
      
      The collateral secures each borrow and acts as a risk mitigation tool against default.
      
      Following are the risks associated with the addition of tokens -
      
      ### Increase in gas price
      Adding of a new token can lead to increase in gas prices for most of the protocol operations. So it's important to 
      know the impact on the protocol. 
      
      ### The protocol risk of insolvency      
        Adding a new token involves the risk of insolvency. While adding new tokens the Aave Community considers the 
        following important points -      
          1. Only the assets with best risk profiles should be supported as collateral
          2. Riskier assets should only be enabled as collateral in isolation mode
          3. New assets with higher risk and lower liquidity should be only considered listed in Isolation mode (for both borrow and collateral use)
      
      ### Centralisation risk      
      A centralized asset accepted as collateral exposes the protocol to centralization risk. The single point of failure 
      risks of the underlying tokens enter into the Aave Protocol due to the centralized asset being accepted as collateral.
      
      ### Risk of collateral assets
      Tokens that are enabled only for supplying and borrowing and are not usable as collateral, present lower risk for 
      the protocol. Collaterals are the assets of the protocol. For solvency, these assets must remain greater than the 
      liabilities borrowed from the protocol. Tokens that can only be used for borrowing should always be excessively backed 
      by collateral assets (e.g., a user can supply DAI as collateral and borrow DAI in variable mode backed by DAI as collateral).
      
      ### Risk of manipulable oracles      
      Assets that have risk of manipulable oracles are listed as single borrow assets. If a user borrows the mentioned asset, 
      they cannot borrow any other asset (Siloed assets).
      
      ### Token Concentration(Low diversity)
      If there are just a couple of tokens in the protocol, then volatilie conditions of those tokens can affect the full protocol. But by 
      having many markets/pools, the risk is diversified.

      ## Smart contract risk
      The focus of smart contract risk is on assessing the security of the code that underlies any asset. Only code that 
      has been thoroughly audited by well-respected auditors is appropriate for the Aave protocol. Users are advised to 
      be vigilant, as even beyond audits, smart contract risk does exist and it can never be eliminated completely.
      
      One interesting mechanism that Aave plans to use to help reduce smart contract risk is bug bounties.
      
      Also, to prevent hacks, Aave protocol advices to onboard the contracts with strict risk mitigation such as supply caps or isolation mode.
      
      ## Counterparty Risk
      When it comes to decentralized governance models, there are varying degrees to which control over funds (or even 
      attack vectors) may be given to the governing architecture. 
      
      Counterparty risk is determined by the level of centralization within the system, which can be measured by 
      things like the number of parties controlling a token's protocol, as well as the number and distribution of holders, 
      and the level of trust in the entity, project, or community running the show.      
      
      ## Market Risk      
      Aave assesses market risk by taking into account the size of the asset pool, as well as supply and demand. The 
      market needs to have enough volume to handle any liquidations, which can lower the price of the asset. Aave uses 
      average daily volume to assess liquidity risk.
      
      The volatility risk is based on the normalized fluctuations in the token price and is calculated as the standard 
      deviation of the logarithmic returns.
      
      Tokens can be subject to sudden volatility spikes, and it is not uncommon to witness a 50% price change within a 
      week or a month. When a price increase occurs, a parameter readjustment may be implemented to limit the risks of 
      new operations.
      
      Finally, Aave also considers the market capitalisation representing the size of the market and potential exposure.
      
      Market risks are used to calibrate the model’s risk parameters. Volatility helps to define the required level of 
      collateralisation. The liquidity risks are contained by liquidation incentives.

    name: Liquidity Risk
    content: |
      The liquidity of the protocol is very important as it allows for the basic protocol operations to take place, such 
      as borrowing assets that are backed by collateral. It also allows users to claim supplied assets along with the 
      interest that has accrued. Measuring the liquidity is done by taking into account the utilisation ratio, which is 
      the amount of the reserve that is currently borrowed in relation to the Aave supply of each asset.
      
      There are tools in place to help mitigate liquidity risk, such as the borrow interest rate model and alternative 
      sources of aToken liquidity.
      
      Aave mitigates the liquidity risk by the following two ways
      
      ### 1. Borrow Interest Rate
      Aave's interest rate algorithm is designed to carefully manage liquidity risk and optimize utilization. The borrow 
      interest rates are derived from the Utilisation Rate, which is an indicator of the availability of capital within 
      the pool. The interest rate model manages liquidity risk in the protocol by incentivizing users to support liquidity: When capital is available, 
      low interest rates encourage borrowing. When capital is scarce, high interest rates encourage repayments of debt and additional supplying.
      
      ### 2. aToken Liquidity
      In order to mitigate aTokens' liquidity risk, Aave has set up liquidity pools on Uniswap and Balancer, as well as 
      the Aave Curve pool. This provides users with alternative sources of liquidity, enabling them to redeem aTokens 
      even when there is no liquidity available in the protocol.

      As the Aave ecosystem expands, so do the potential risks and rewards. Security is always our top priority, and we 
      have put in place best practices like automated testing and independent security audits to mitigate risk. Below you 
      will find a summary of our recent security audits, which cover all aspects of the Aave protocol including smart 
      contracts, algorithms, stress testing, and governance. Audit reports are available on GitHub.
